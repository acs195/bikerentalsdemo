Context

 A company rents bikes under following options:
    1. Rental by hour, charging $5 per hour
    2. Rental by day, charging $20 a day
    3. Rental by week, changing $60 a week
    4. Family Rental, is a promotion that can include from 3 to 5 Rentals
       (of any type) with a discount of 30% of the total price

Assignment:
    Implement a set of classes to model this domain and logic
    Add automated tests to ensure a coverage over 85%
    Use a public Git repository such as GitHub to store and version your code.
    Apply all the recommended practices you would use in a real project.
    Have in mind that your code should be: Extensible, maintainable.
    Consider that is possible that in a near future we should be able to add a new promotion.

     Add a README.md file to the root of your repository to explain:
        your design.
        the development practices you applied.
        how run the application and the tests.
        Assumptions, do not forget that you can contact us to ask some questions.

Note: we don't expect any kind of application, just a set of classes with its automated tests.
What we would like to find in your delivery:
    At least 1 design pattern
    Use Git flow
    Use a dependency manager
    Error handling
    Proper logging (you can use log4j or whatever you like)
    Any helper library you find useful
    Try not to hardcode anything (itâ€™s only ok to hardcode in tests classes)

Deliverables:
    The link to your repository
